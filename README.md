# Hypothesis Testing, ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc analysis

**ANalysis Of VAriance (commonly called ANOVA)** is a group of statistical techniques that test the difference of means among three or more groups. It's a powerful tool for determining whether population means are different across groups and for answering a wide range of business questions.

When our categorical variable has two classes, we generally go for T-test to check whether the difference between the means of two classes is statistically significant. But if our categorical variable has 3 or more classes, we perform ANOVA to check whether the differences among the means of all classes is statistically significant.
